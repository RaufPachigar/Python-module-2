What is a Tuple?
A tuple in Python is an immutable, ordered collection of items. Like lists, tuples can hold elements of different data
types, including integers, floats, strings, and even other lists or tuples. Once a tuple is created,
its elements cannot be modified, which means you can't add, remove, or change items within a tuple.

The key difference between tuples and lists is that while tuples are immutable objects, lists are mutable.
 This means tuples cannot be changed while lists can be modified. Tuples are also more memory efficient than the lists.
 When it comes to time efficiency, tuples have a slight advantage over lists especially
 when we consider lookup value. If you have data that shouldn’t change, you should choose tuple data type over lists.
