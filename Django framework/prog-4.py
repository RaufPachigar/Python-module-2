#What is Django URLs?make program to create django urls

# In Django, URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) play a critical role in routing requests to the appropriate views within your application. Django uses a URL dispatcher, which is defined in the urls.py file, to map URL patterns to views. This way, when a user accesses a particular URL, Django knows which view function to execute and what content to display.

# How Django URLs Work
# URL Patterns: In Django, URL patterns are defined using regular expressions or path converters that match specific patterns.
# URL Configuration (urls.py): The main URL configuration file for a Django project is typically located at project_name/urls.py. Here, you define a list of URL patterns that direct traffic to views.
# Path Function: Django provides a path() function to make it easy to map URLs to views. Each path() includes:
# A route or pattern (e.g., 'home/')
# A view function that handles requests to that URL
# Optionally, a name to make the URL easily referable across the app
# Example Program: Setting Up Django URLs
# Step 1: Create a View in views.py
# In your app’s views.py file, define a view function that you want to connect to a URL. Here’s an example of a simple "Hello, World!" view:


# from django.http import HttpResponse

# def hello_world(request):
#     return HttpResponse("Hello, World!")
# Step 2: Define URLs in urls.py
# In the app’s urls.py file, map the URL pattern to the view function. If urls.py doesn’t exist in your app, create it.


# from django.urls import path
# from . import views

# urlpatterns = [
#     path('hello/', views.hello_world, name='hello_world'),
# ]
# Step 3: Include App URLs in the Project’s Main urls.py
# In the project’s main urls.py (usually located at project_name/urls.py), include the URLs from your app.


# from django.contrib import admin
# from django.urls import path, include

# urlpatterns = [
#     path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
#     path('myapp/', include('myapp.urls')),  # Include URLs from myapp
# ]
# In this example:

# Accessing http://127.0.0.1:8000/myapp/hello/ will display “Hello, World!” as the response, handled by the hello_world view in views.py.
# The include() function allows you to keep your URL configurations modular and organized by separating app-level and project-level URLs.
# Summary
# Define views in views.py.
# Map URL patterns in urls.py for the app.
# Include app URLs in the project’s main urls.py file.
# This approach helps keep your URL patterns well-organized and scalable as your project grows.
