# #Explain what does django-admin.py make messages command is used for?


# In Django, the django-admin.py makemessages command is 
# used for internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) of your application. 
# This command helps developers extract translatable strings from their code and templates,
# allowing for the creation of translation files that can be used to provide support for multiple languages in a Django application.

# Here's a breakdown of how the makemessages command works:

# Purpose:
# Extract Translatable Strings: The command scans your Python code and templates for strings marked for 
# translation (typically wrapped in functions like gettext, gettext_lazy, or ugettext).
# Create Translation Files: It generates .po files (Portable Object files) 
# for each language you want to support. These files contain the original strings and their translations.
# Usage
# To use the makemessages command, you typically run it from the command line 
# within your Django project directory. The basic syntax is:


# django-admin makemessages -l <language_code>
# -l <language_code>: This option specifies the language code for the translations you want to create. For example,
# -l fr for French, -l es for Spanish, etc.
