#What relationship is appropriate for Course and Faculty?

# The relationship between Course and Faculty is typically an association. Specifically, 
# it can be modeled as an aggregation relationship because:

# A Faculty can teach multiple Courses.
# A Course can have one or more Faculty members assigned to it. This represents a "has-a" relationship.
