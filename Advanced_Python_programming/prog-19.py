#How Do You Handle Exceptions With Try/Except/Finally In Python? Explain with coding snippets.





# Exception handling in Python ensures the program continues executing smoothly even when an error occurs. The structure includes:

# try: Code that might raise an exception.
# except: Block to handle the exception.
# finally: Block that always runs after try and except, regardless of whether an exception was raised.

# Example:

try:
    x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / x
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input! Please enter a number.")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Division by zero is not allowed!")
finally:
    print("Execution finished, cleaning up resources.")


# In this example:

# If a non-integer value is entered, ValueError is handled.
# If x is 0, ZeroDivisionError is handled.
# The finally block always executes, whether or not an error occurs.
